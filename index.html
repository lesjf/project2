      <h2>The History of Makeup Artistry</h2>
      <p>
        Since as far back as the days of Cleopatra to today’s
        multibillion-dollar beauty industry, cosmetics – makeup – has been a
        large factor in creating a certain standard of beauty. Throughout
        history, typically someone of power or wealth would use copper or lead
        or even the leftover smudge of a burnt match to create “color” and
        beauty to enhance their appearance. Trends varied and thankfully, so did
        the evolution of cosmetics. Nowadays we have makeup that has to undergo
        rigorous testing and safety measure to give women and artists the
        materials they need to create a certain look or merely emphasize a
        feature that won’t be harmful to the skin. Rather than having to use
        leeches to draw the color from your face, you can just use a lighter
        foundation or instead of using blood to color your lips, there are
        thousands of lipstick shades to choose from. The worse side effect is
        perhaps a rash or an allergic reaction. Chemicals are carefully chosen
        and tested to create the makeup of present day. Through the course of
        time, makeup has been utilized to bring out a woman’s beauty or create a
        theatrical character. It conveys emotion, instills confidence, and
        captures your attention.
